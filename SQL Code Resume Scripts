Example
--Creating Table with Client Information:

CREATE TABLE client_example (client_ID PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
client_name varchar (50), client_lastname varchar (50), 
client_number NUM (20), client_gender varchar (5), client_address 
 varchar (50),  client_city varchar (50), client_state varchar (5),
education_level varchar (15), income_level varchar (50), card_category 
varchar (50), credit_limit varchar (10), months_inactive_12_mon varchar (10), 
average_utilization_ratio varchar (10));

--Getting Client’s Phone Number and Joining with Client_ID:

SELECT client_ID, client_name, array_agg(client.number) as contact_number 
FROM Example_table
JOIN contact_number on client_ID = example.client_id
GROUP BY example.client_ID, client_name;

---Updating Table with Client First Name, Last Name, and DOB:

UPDATE client_example 
SET	[client’s First Name] = Pers.PsnFirst, [client’s Late Name] =  
Pers.PsnLaSt, [client’s Date of Birth] =  Pers.Psnous,	[client Name]	= Pers.ClientName
FROM [AggregateDatabase1].dbo.[client_table] Pers
JOIN  clientID.Example  samp
ON  Pers.MasterKey =  samp.ID
WHERE Pers.IDOrganization = Pers.IDMasterOrganization
AND  Pers.Idstatus = 1

-- Is client income level a major factor in determining credit card attrition? 

a.	What are the number of customers in each card category?
SELECT card_category, COUNT (*) FROM client_example
GROUP BY card_category ORDER BY  COUNT

b.	Do low-income earners have high incidents of credit card inactivity >= 3 months? 

SELECT months_inactive_12_mon, income_level, 
COUNT (months_inactive_12_mon) AS Inactive 
FROM client_example
WHERE months_inactive_12_mon >= 3 
GROUP BY months_inactive_12_mon, income_level
ORDER BY Inactive DESC

--Conclusion and Potential Areas of Improvement: 

The data demonstrates total clients with Less than $40k income level are most inactive with credit card usage over a 12-month period. 
To improve client credit card usage various strategies could be implemented such as: increase of credit limit for customers in the income 
level, improved alerts for payment deadline, and aligning rewards through merchant/brand promotions with clients to accelerate credit card usage.
